## Project description

This unnamed project (for now) is a content sharing platform that connects people from all four corners of the earth to share knowledge in what they are passionate about. The platform is powered by a Django REST API and React.

## Color palette

- I used this color palette because it fit well with how I intended the logo design to be.

## Sprints (link to my KANBAN can be found [here](https://github.com/users/pakkONE/projects/3/views/1))

## Bugs

- I couldn't upload images from the front end to the API and could for the life of me not understand why. I downgraded React, react-bootstrap and react-router-dom and the whole API to older versions just to make sure that it would work. After two days of debugging I finally found out that I had not returned a value on the function validating the image in the API.
